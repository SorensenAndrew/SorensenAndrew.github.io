Rich snippets are essentially another way to improve your listings in google. By putting microdata in your html code google will pull sites with it to the top. Not only that, but having those pictures or data displayed makes a user more likely to click on your website. With the additional information provided by the microdata your search result will stand out from others by having a picture or small area under it- all depending on what content is put into the microdata.
