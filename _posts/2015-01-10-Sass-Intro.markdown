My first issue that arose while using Sass was getting anything to work at all. Once I redirected the directory  to the file I was actually trying to change it started going much better.

After that I kept running into conflicting code in the css I was trying to change, since this file started with a bunch of css/sass already implemented.

The final issue I encountered, which I still cannot fix, was the fact that the styling inside my nesting seems to be applying outside of the nesting element and I am not sure as to why.

Also, a lot of things are bold now. I did this on purpose to demonstrate the extend feature. I recognize that it looks odd.
