The web designer that I researched was Josh Clark- who was featured in the Jeffrey Zeldman documentary. Josh Clark is the founder of globalmoxie.com, which is a website that focuses on mobile design. Prior to web design, Josh Clark did a lot of stuff that fell over a pretty wide range of fields. Clark was a management consultant, a producer of a PBS program, wrote trivia questions for a game show, and created a fitness program that was apparently very successful. All this on top of a few things that, based on the way they were wrote, sounded like a joke. Im just going to leave it as it was written- "He shared his three words of Russian with Mikhail Gorbachev, strolled the ranch with Nancy Reagan, hobnobbed with Rockefellers". So there's that, I guess that goes to show you can do pretty much anything with a B.A. from Harvard.

Clark runs a blog on mobile design on his website and has published a few books on the subject as well. He also has an active Twitter account of the same name as his website/blog. His biggest book is called "Tapworthy" and as the title suggests it is about mobile design. He does do talks fairly regularly, when I checked his Twitter account he was actually doing a free talk in Philadelphia. He has also done talks through An Event Apart.

What I really took away from researching Josh Clark was his motton of "No pain, no pain", which he applies to both web design and his fitness program. This is the way I like to look at web design as well. A user's experience should be as painless as possible at all times. With the massive amount of options for any type of site you can think of, a painful user experience will be quickly abandoned.
