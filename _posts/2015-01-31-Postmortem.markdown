So, I had varying degrees of trouble with this months work. I had a lot of issues with jekyll and overwriting styles and things of that nature, but after enough hammering at it I seemed to make it through. I really enjoyed sass and working with that, it will probably be my favorite takeaway from the course. I think with more time I could have been able to break more into the styling system of the site and make it a bit more unique, but given all the struggles I had with the program, I think my project worked out well.
