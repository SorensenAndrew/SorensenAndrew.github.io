The first business I found that I wanted to work on was the Adams Hall Schieffelin & Smith, P.A. law firm. They have a website, but is very basic and I think could be a lot better.

The other business I saw was Relax in Comfort, a mattress sales department.  However their website has really poorly placed ads and the colors make it feel like a Publix.

To start I'll look around each page's website and seeing what it is that they are trying to accomplish.
