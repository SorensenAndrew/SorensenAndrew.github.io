My first issues arose with getting the folder associated with my github to get the mixin's to work. Ultimately, I could not and had to use the file we practiced in during class.

Early on I had a few issues trying to use the functions built into sass, but I was able to figure out how to get them to work eventually. After that I learned that you didn't actually need to use those functions and could simply pass your own parameters. Either way, both seemed to work.

The only other thing I could not get to work at all was the media query mixin. I even looked it up through css tricks, then tried a modified version of that of my own concoction- which didnt work either.
